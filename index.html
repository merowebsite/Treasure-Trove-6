            <h2>Utsav Sapkota! A youth with an amazing perspective of 'TIME'.</h2>
            <p>He feels TIME is beyond the specific definition and neither can be explained within a boundary. He believes utilizing time in productive ways and having optimistic visions on time is always essential for a good quality life. He beautifully explains that controlling TIME is not possible so going on with the flow of TIME and feeling blissful on every moment we spent is crucial. He highlights that the TIME we have while we are alive is much precious and that is how we can shape our future. A correct work at correct time in a correct way is the wisest thing one can do. He is worried on the present situation where people are not being able to do the regular jobs and duties they were supposed to. So, he suggests to take the necessary precautions and utilize the time at best from home. He cautions us that spending time on just having fun, sleeping or on only movies may not result on productivity. Being engaged on productive works with joy always counts. He reminds us that, empty mind is a devil’s workshop staying passive with time only brings negativity. He wants each of us to find the potential, passion, vision and purpose of life and spent time on these. To respect the creativity within ourselves and letting them to fly with beautiful wings is the actual justice to life. His next interesting perspective on utilization of TIME on experimenting with anything that we find fascinating around us. He requests all of us to utilize our time creatively with joy by taking care of our mental and physical health that will always help us and is much appreciated.</p>
